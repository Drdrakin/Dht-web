# Dht-web
ESP32 Project consisted of an web interface which displays sensor data captured from a DHT sensor, showcasing differences in temperature and humidity.

For the project to work, it was used an ESP32 DevKit. No changes to its configurations are needed.
To use the DHT sensor, it was applied the 'DHT sensor library' by Adafruit and 'DHT sensor library for ESP32' by beege_tokyo
